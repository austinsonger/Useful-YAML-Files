    Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) is a systematic analysis process used by response team members and asset owners 
    to identify and communicate the stages of an attack. The patterns, behaviors, tactics, techniques, and 
    procedures (TTP) used by adversaries are described using this analysis to subsequently develop COA designed 
    to target and engage adversaries.
