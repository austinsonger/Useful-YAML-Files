name: Pingboard
description: Pingboard is a software program designed to visually represent the structure of an organization,
  serving both as an organizational chart and an employee directory. It facilitates the building of interactive
  org charts and management of employee profiles. It also serves as a unified platform for storing employee
  data, enabling transparent and efficient internal communication. The software supports the visualization
  of departments, teams, and individual roles within the organization. Despite being developed by an HR
  tech company, its main focus isn't just on employee retention and engagement; it equally takes into
  account efficient organization structure representation.
