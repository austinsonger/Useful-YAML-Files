name: HubSpot Meetings Extension
description: HubSpot Meetings Extension is a tool that streamlines the process of scheduling appointments.
  It works by linking directly with an individual's calendar and coordinating with HubSpot's CRM
  to automate meeting arrangements without requiring multiple emails. Users can set their availability
  and share a link that allows contacts to select a convenient time slot. All meetings are automatically
  logged and tracked within HubSpot for easy reference. Additionally, the app features two-way syncing
  with both Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar, thus facilitating simultaneous logging of meetings
  in the CRM, creation of calendar events, and the sending of invites to attendees.
