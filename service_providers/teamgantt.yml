description: TeamGantt is an online tool that allows users to create Gantt charts quickly and easily.
  Users can schedule tasks using a simple drag-and-drop functionality, eliminating the need for downloads
  or special training. Momentarily, it enables users to develop an understanding of their project timelines
  more efficiently. While the duplicate description emphasizes its free usage, it's important to remember
  such conditions could change, it's always prudent to check the current status.
