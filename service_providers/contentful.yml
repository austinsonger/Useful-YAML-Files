  this gives developers access to APIs that they can use to manage, distribute, and integrate content
  across different platforms and devices. It also gives them the freedom to utilize their favored tools
  and frameworks to present and deploy content \u2013 a feature designed to enhance flexibility and
  speed. Further, the application supports collaboration, innovation, and the delivery of impactful
  experiences, especially in instances where content is critical to business performance.
