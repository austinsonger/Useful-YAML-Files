description: Amie is a productivity application that combines various features to enhance task management
  and scheduling. Unlike standard tools, Amie merges to-do lists, personalized customer relationship management,
  and a simple yet functional calendar into a single, unified platform. It therefore enables a user to
  schedule time for tasks, events, and contact management, all in one place. Despite being a comprehensive
  tool, its visual aesthetic lends an element of ease and enjoyment to the user experience. It is a free-to-try
  application.
