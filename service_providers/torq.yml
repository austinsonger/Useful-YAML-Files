description: Torq is a modern application designed to support the automation of security measures. It
  is adaptable and able to work easily with pre-existing tools, ensuring a smooth scaling process as a
  business grows and its needs change. This versatile platform doesn't need coding knowledge to operate,
  making it accessible for both security and operations teams. It responds to security threats by activating
  pre-set workflows. Unlike many apps in its category, Torq offers true scalability for large organizations
  and operates at a speed that outpaces most Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) tools.
