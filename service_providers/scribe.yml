description: Scribe is a software application that creates step-by-step guides automatically. It uses
  both recorded processes and screenshots to generate these guides, making it an efficient tool for creating
  instructional materials. The app provides a method for users to easily create and share their work processes.
  The produced guides include text, links, and screenshots, offering a comprehensive illustration of any
  process. This feature of instant creation of visual guides saves a considerable amount of time which
  otherwise would have been used in training and explaining tasks.
