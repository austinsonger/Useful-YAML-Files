description: Google Colaboratory, colloquially known as Colab, is a cost-free, cloud-based platform by
  Google. It was primarily designed to allow its users to write and run Python code collaboratively. Inside
  Colab, computing environments, known as 'Runtimes', provide the required computational resources to
  run the code. They also execute machine learning models and perform data analysis tasks. This platform
  doesn't necessitate setting up physical development environments, which lets users utilize Google's
  infrastructure for their computing needs. Users can opt for either CPU or GPU runtimes depending on
  their respective requirements. Due to its versatile range of functions, Colab is used widely amongst
  data scientists, researchers, and developers for coding experiments and running machine learning tests.
  It further allows integration of Python executable code with charts, images, and text into a single
  document, saved in Google Drive.
