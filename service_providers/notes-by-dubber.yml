name: Notes by Dubber
description: Notes by Dubber is a notetaking service designed to enhance productivity during meetings
  on platforms such as Zoom. It uses artificial intelligence to automatically record, transcribe, and
  summarize meetings, which can then be used to formulate meeting agendas. This allows meeting participants
  to focus more on the discussions rather than note-taking. The application also generates transcripts
  and identifies important action items, providing a useful summary of the meeting for reference.
