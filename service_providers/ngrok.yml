description: Ngrok is a tool designed to aid developers in their work. By exposing local servers to the
  internet, it simplifies the sharing and testing of web projects. It is API-first, meaning it can work
  with various application programming interfaces. Moreover, it operates as a unified ingress platform
  and integrates several technical aspects, such as a reverse proxy, firewall, API gateway, and global
  load balancing, into a single system. Users are not required to modify their code to use ngrok, making
  it even easier and more secure.
