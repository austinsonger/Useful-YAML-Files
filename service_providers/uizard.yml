description: Uizard is a software that uses artificial intelligence to convert basic wireframes into functional
  prototypes and front-end code. This process allows users to quickly transform their ideas into usable
  digital interfaces. The platform is particularly helpful for those who may not have a strong background
  in coding or design since it simplifies the creation of mobile apps, websites, and user interfaces.
  The main distinguishing feature of Uizard is its AI-powered technology which streamlines the design
  and development process, making it both efficient and accessible to people without specialized skills.
