name: Jira Cloud for Sheets
description: Jira Cloud for Sheets is a tool that links Jira and Google Sheets, enabling users to import,
  study, and present their Jira-based data straight from Google Sheets. This connection makes it possible
  for users to generate reports, adjust data, and work collectively within the confines of a spreadsheet.
  The integration simplifies the processes by eliminating the need to switch between platforms.
