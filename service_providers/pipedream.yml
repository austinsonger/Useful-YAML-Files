description: Pipedream is a platform designed to simplify the connection of APIs for developers. This
  tool aids in the automation of workflows by offering a serverless computing environment to run code
  in response to events, such as receiving webhook payloads. It saves developers from struggling with
  tasks like writing repetitive code or managing infrastructure, enabling faster development of customized
  integrations. Although it offers code-level control for those who require it, no coding is necessary
  for users who don't. Currently, Pipedream is utilized by more than 750,000 developers worldwide.
