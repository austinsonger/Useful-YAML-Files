description: Anyword is an artificial intelligence-based platform primarily used by marketers to develop
  content that is consistent with their brand and supports business growth. The application is recognized
  by many leading corporations including Amazon and Alibaba for its ability to analyze vast amounts of
  marketing data and provide output that aids in strategic decision-making across multiple channels. With
  the ability to regularly monitor and enhance the users' content, Anyword on average improves business
  outcomes by thirty percent. Despite being one of the more sophisticated AI models, it does lack the
  capability to predict what may specifically work for a particular brand or audience.
