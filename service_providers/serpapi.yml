description: SerpApi is a data extraction tool used by developers to collect search results from prominent
  search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo. By enabling access to real-time search data via an API,
  it allows for this information to be incorporated into users' own applications, tools, or platforms.
  The application removes the need to understand the complexities of web scraping, managing tasks such
  as handling proxies and solving captchas. Furthermore, it also interprets any rich structured data,
  making it convenient and efficient for developers to use.
