description: Doppler is a platform designed for developers and security teams. It focuses on securely
  synchronizing secrets and app configurations across various devices, environments, and team members,
  retiring the use of .env files. Alongside, it integrates a feature, similar to Doodle's, for swiftly
  scheduling meetings by setting up polls or using the Bookable Calendar. This eliminates the need for
  long email threads and lets users easily choose their preferred dates and times. In essence, Doppler
  aids in streamlining tasks, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency.
