  developers and system architects in understanding and improving their cloud infrastructures. Cloudcraft
  features smart components for several AWS services like EC2, ELB, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, among others,
  making it easy to create detailed architecture diagrams. Users can also securely connect their AWS accounts
