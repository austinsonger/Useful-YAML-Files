description: Honeycomb is a tool that offers helpful features to software developers and operations teams.
  It aids in examining and debugging software systems that are in use, or "in production." Honeycomb particularly
  excels when these systems are distributed, or spread out across several different places. This is achieved
  through its ability to provide detailed insights into software systems, assisting users in understanding
  and fixing the issues present. It does not promote trials or offer any free usage.
