description: Datadog is an online-based platform focused on monitoring and analyzing different aspects
  of a business, including its infrastructure, applications, and logs. The application caters to cloud-based
  workflows and provides a unified look at the metrics from all tools, apps, and services an organization
  utilizes. This allows businesses to gain a real-time understanding of their operations. Despite its
  service offering a 'trial for free' option, it is best to consider the app's full capability and benefits
  it can provide to suit your business needs.
