description: Marvel Prototyping is a tool that enables users to create functional prototypes of their
  app ideas, even without coding skills. Through this platform, users can take their initial concepts
  or drawings and turn them into interactive app demos in a matter of minutes. The app allows for the
  transformation of drawings into dynamic prototypes by capturing images and linking them, facilitating
  an easy transition from idea to visual prototype.
