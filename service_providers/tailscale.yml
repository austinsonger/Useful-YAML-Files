description: Tailscale is a networking application that uses the WireGuard protocol to safely link devices
  over the internet, simulating a private network. Suitable for both individuals and organizations, it
  simplifies the process of setting up a private network without any configuration, thus omitting the
  conventional challenges of VPN installations. Users can easily access services or devices from any location
  or network. In just a matter of minutes, Tailscale can be installed on any device, providing remote
  access regardless of physical location.
