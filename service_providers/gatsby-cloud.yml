name: Gatsby Cloud
description: Gatsby Cloud is a platform engineered to improve the deployment and performance of websites
  built with Gatsby. It allows developers to construct, refine, and launch secure, high-performing websites
  that can handle extensive traffic. The platform offers distinct features such as incremental builds
  and immediate previews, coupled with globally distributed content, leading to fluid user interactions.
  It also integrates with a variety of content sources, plugins, and APIs, simplifying the development
  process. Gatsby Cloud seeks to eliminate technical hurdles, enabling developers to concentrate on creating
  superb websites. However, it does not offer serverless platform features or an intuitive git-based workflow
  like some others do.
