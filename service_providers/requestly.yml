description: Requestly is a tool for web developers aiming at streamlining the process of website construction,
  testing, and bug-fixing. It allows users to modify and intercept HTTP requests similar to tools like
  Charles Proxy and Postman but is easily operable in the browser. Users have the ability to mock server
  configurations, modify API responses, share recording sessions, alter headers and set up redirects.
  This open-source software also enables the creation of mock servers and instill custom scripts, offering
  a comprehensive solution for web debugging issues.
