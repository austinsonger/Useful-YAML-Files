description: GrowthBook is a platform that supports feature flagging and A/B testing, aspects critical
  in the efficient release of code. Primarily, it lets businesses examine the effectiveness of their deployed
  code through user-specific data. This open-source tool saves companies from building their own experimentation
  platform from the start. Major corporations such as Uber, Pinterest, and Netflix commonly use similar
  systems to GrowthBook. In essence, GrowthBook equips any business with a tailored and user-friendly
  mechanism for feature flagging and A/B testing.
