description: ContactOut is a user-friendly application designed to assist users in locating direct email
  addresses and phone numbers from LinkedIn profiles. By providing this information, it establishes a
  more direct means of communication for recruiters, sales professionals, and others. These individuals
  can then use this tool to find and reach out to potential candidates or leads outside of the LinkedIn
  platform. Despite its utility, it's worth noting that ContactOut doesn't substitute for an individual's
  own outreach or networking efforts.
