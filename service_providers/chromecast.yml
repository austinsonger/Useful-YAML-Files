description: Chromecast is a device that Google has developed to facilitate media streaming. It enables
  users to send, or 'cast', content from their smartphones, tablets, or computers to their television
  or other display devices wirelessly. Users need to be on the same Wi-Fi network to cast videos, music,
  images, and even web content directly to their TV. This makes it an easy and cost-effective way to view
  streaming content on a larger screen. Chromecast can work with several apps and services, adding flexibility
  to the user's viewing options.
