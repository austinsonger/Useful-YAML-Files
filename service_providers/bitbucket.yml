description: Bitbucket is an online service owned by Atlassian that hosts version control repositories.
  It is designed for managing and storing source code and development projects that are regulated through  Mercurial
  or Git. The service provides useful features such as pull requests, branch permissions, and in-line
  commenting, which make collaboration on code easier. Bitbucket also integrates well with other Atlassian
  products. Furthermore, Bitbucket Cloud, a component of the service, is specifically devised to enhance
  operating compatibility for teams using Jira through its Git-based code and CI/CD tool.
