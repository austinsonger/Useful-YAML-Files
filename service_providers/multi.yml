description: The Multi app operates as a user-oriented platform that facilitates the swift creation and
  launch of WebView applications, which can be customized for any geographic area or traffic source. It's
  designed to enable speedy app deployment by furnishing features like pre-set cloaking. Additionally,
  Multi features a multiplayer collaboration tool specifically tailored for MacOS. This utility allows
  teams to collaborate within shared apps; users can point, draw, and conduct edits with an experience
  akin to working directly on their own computers. This app is wrapped in a well-designed, native MacOS
  interface.
