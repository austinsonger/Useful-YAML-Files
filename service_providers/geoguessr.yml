description: GeoGuessr is a digital geography game that immerses players in various global locations via
  Google Street View imagery. The player's objective is to deduce their location using only visual cues
  and place a guess on the world map. Their score is determined by the proximity of their guess to the
  actual spot. This game was developed by Anton Walln in 2013 during a harsh winter in Sweden. GeoGuessr
  embarks players on a global tour, testing their knowledge and perceptiveness of different surroundings.
