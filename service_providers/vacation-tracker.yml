description: Vacation Tracker is a straightforward tool designed for managing and tracking leave within
  a team or organization. It simplifies the process of scheduling and tracking time off, allowing employees
  and teams a transparent view of their paid time off (PTO) availability. This can be done through the
  built-in functions in commonly-used platforms like Microsoft Teams, Slack, or Google Workspace. There's
  also a web-based dashboard where administrators can adjust organizational settings and supervise the
  leave statuses of their staff. Employees, in turn, can utilize the same dashboard to submit leave requests
  and review their remaining leave balances.
