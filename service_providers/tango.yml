description: Tango is a cloud-based platform that aims to improve productivity by automating the capture
  of processes. It has the capability to quickly convert any workflow into a simple, step-by-step guide.
  The platform, which includes a browser extension and desktop application, enables teams to document,
  exchange, and access key data whenever and wherever it is necessary. Tango Analytics uses purpose-built
  GIS solutions for location development control. Furthermore, Tango allows for the creation of brief
  how-to guides to conduct on-the-job team training. Tango's software modules are also licensed by Microsoft.
