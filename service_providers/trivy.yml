description: Trivy is a vulnerability scanner specifically designed for containers, primarily used in
  Continuous Integration (CI) processes. It identifies vulnerabilities in Operating System (OS) packages,
  which include Debian, Ubuntu, and Alpine, along with application dependencies, to ensure the safety
  of container images from known security risks. As an open-source tool, it offers a wide range of security
  scanning capabilities, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) discovery,
  and cloud scanning. It plays a crucial role in maintaining Kubernetes security.
