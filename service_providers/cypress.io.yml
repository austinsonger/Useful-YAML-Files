description: Cypress.io offers a straightforward application for conducting front end automated testing.
  The tool allows users to run unit and integration tests in a browser for any application or component.
  Developed with an open-source framework, it simplifies the process of front-end testing by making use
  of JavaScript component testing and end-to-end (E2E) testing. The goal is to make testing less difficult
  and more efficient. It's an appropriate tool for any application or component that operates within a
  browser.
