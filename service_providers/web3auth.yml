description: Web3Auth serves as a cloud-based infrastructure designed for decentralized applications and
  wallets. It provides unique solutions for multi-factor authentication without having to hold or keep
  watch over users' information (non-custodial). Moreover, it offers a simple and secure way to access
  digital assets and identities. Equipped with Key Management and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Account
  Abstraction (AA) features, it allows various platforms to link and work together. Web3Auth is particularly
  helpful for Web3 wallets and applications in offering a smooth login experience to different kinds of
  users, be they mainstream or familiar with Web3.
