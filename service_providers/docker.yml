description: Docker is a popular platform that makes the process of deploying and managing applications
  easier by using an approach called containerization. Essentially, this approach allows developers to
  put applications and everything they need to run, into independent containers. This way, they can be
  sure the applications run the same way regardless of the environment. Docker enhances the procedure
  from development to production, supporting productive teamwork, scalability, and fast deployment. Furthermore,
  Docker favours an open platform for creating, delivering, and running applications that are distributed
  or dispersed in different locations.
