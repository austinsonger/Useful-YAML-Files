description: MURAL is a digital platform that facilitates visual collaboration among teams. This application
  allows groups to brainstorm, strategize, examine, and agree on intricate projects within a shared digital
  workspace. Users can conveniently populate this workspace with ideas by dragging and dropping elements
  like sticky notes, images, links, and documents. MURAL also encompasses flowcharts and other visual
  techniques to aid in understanding and organizing complex ideas. This platform, accessible via the web
  or mobile devices, fosters team unity and enhances virtual connections securely. Its goal is to make
  collaborations more of an engaging process rather than a mundane meeting.
