description: Parabol is an application designed to improve team collaboration, especially for remote teams.
  Its main function is to assist in conducting both real-time and asynchronous meetings by collecting
  activity data from online collaborations, which it then converts into insightful reports. Not only does
  Parabol simplify meeting procedures by rolling team notes and tasks into summaries, but it also offers
  a perspective on leadership dynamics within the team. The app can integrate well with other platforms
  like Jira, Confluence, Github, and Slack, and is both complimentary and open-source.
