description: Kaleido AI is a software that utilizes artificial intelligence to automatically remove backgrounds
  from both images and videos. It's used by designers who can generate bulk designs, benefiting from the
  software's easy integration plug-ins. The primary value the software provides is the simplification
  of the creative process, as well as time and cost reduction. It's a useful tool particularly for computer-based
  work involving frequent use of visual elements. Despite the company also offering other products and
  hiring, this description primarily focuses on its AI-based image and video processing software.
