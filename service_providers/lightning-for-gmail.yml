name: Lightning for Gmail
description: Lightning for Gmail is a tool designed to connect Google's G Suite Gmail inbox with Salesforce's
  CRM. It facilitates the simple transfer of emails and meetings, assigning them to relevant contacts,
  accounts, and opportunities within Salesforce. This compatibility is extended to both the Classic and
  Lightning versions of Salesforce. Furthermore, the application allows users to access pertinent CRM
  information directly from their Gmail inbox, helping to streamline their workflow. Although it is often
  widely used in sales, customer service, marketing, commerce, and IT, it can be used by any user of Salesforce,
  regardless of their field.
