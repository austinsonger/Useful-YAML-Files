  objective: "Effectively draw upon expert knowledge to discover plausible risk scenarios that require mitigation by our larger security organization."
  key_result: "Written analysis and the production of scenarios that guide mitigation efforts."

getting_started:
  tips:
    - "üëÇ Listen: The more you're talking, the less you're listening."
    - "üî® Break the rules: This document helps move a discussion along, but great interviews go off script and dive in."
    - "üìã Capture notes: Balance conversation and note-taking. Work with a partner if possible."

agenda:
  - "Introduce yourself."
  - "Get to know the interviewee."
  - "Ask them open-ended questions."
  - "Take notes."
  - "Organize the notes into a deliverable."

steps:
  - step: "üëã Introduce yourself"
    details: "You‚Äôre the stranger! That‚Äôs OK. This means you have free reign to ask naive questions and ask for clarification. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre valuable. Make sure the person knows who you are and why you‚Äôre qualified. The interviewees may think you‚Äôre sent to judge their performance. This shouldn‚Äôt be the case. Clarify this upfront."
  
  - step: "üòé Get to know the interviewee"
    questions:
      - "How would you describe your role?"
      - "What are you hoping to work on this week?"

      - "What are your regularly occurring meetings?"
      - "What projects are you cheering on that make your life easier?"
      - "Who are you frequently collaborating with?"
      - "Can you describe a process from task to close?"

  - step: "‚ùì Ask the interviewee open-ended questions"
    details: "Conversations are never scripted. Good interviews flow naturally towards interesting subjects. A good interviewer should be prepared to explore the knowledge of the interviewee with a toolbox of questions and methods."
